# Dictionaries

'''Dictionary
Dictionaries are used to store data values in key:value pairs.

A dictionary is a collection which is ordered*, changeable and do not allow duplicates.

As of Python version 3.7, dictionaries are ordered. In Python 3.6 and earlier, dictionaries are unordered.

Dictionaries are written with curly brackets, and have keys and values:

Example
Create and print a dictionary:'''

thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
print(thisdict)

'''Dictionary Items
Dictionary items are ordered, changeable, and does not allow duplicates.

Dictionary items are presented in key:value pairs, and can be referred to by using the key name.

Example
Print the "brand" value of the dictionary:'''

print(thisdict["brand"])

'''Ordered or Unordered?
As of Python version 3.7, dictionaries are ordered. In Python 3.6 and earlier, dictionaries are unordered.

When we say that dictionaries are ordered, it means that the items have a defined order, and that order will not change.

Unordered means that the items does not have a defined order, you cannot refer to an item by using an index.

Changeable
Dictionaries are changeable, meaning that we can change, add or remove items after the dictionary has been created.

Duplicates Not Allowed
Dictionaries cannot have two items with the same key:

Example
Duplicate values will overwrite existing values:

thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964,
  "year": 2020
}
print(thisdict)'''

'''Dictionary Length
To determine how many items a dictionary has, use the len() function:

Example
Print the number of items in the dictionary:'''

print(len(thisdict))

'''Dictionary Items - Data Types
The values in dictionary items can be of any data type:'''

'''type()
From Python's perspective, dictionaries are defined as objects with the data type 'dict':

<class 'dict'>'''

'''Accessing Items
You can access the items of a dictionary by referring to its key name, inside square brackets:

Example
Get the value of the "model" key:

thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}'''
x = thisdict["model"]
'''There is also a method called get() that will give you the same result:

Example
Get the value of the "model" key:'''

y = thisdict.get("model")
'''Get Keys
The keys() method will return a list of all the keys in the dictionary.

Example
Get a list of the keys:'''

z = thisdict.keys()
'''The list of the keys is a view of the dictionary, meaning that any changes done to the dictionary will be reflected in the keys list.

Example
Add a new item to the original dictionary, and see that the keys list gets updated as well:'''

car = {
"brand": "Ford",
"model": "Mustang",
"year": 1964
}

z = car.keys()

print(z) #before the change

car["color"] = "white"

print(z) #after the change

'''Get Values
The values() method will return a list of all the values in the dictionary.

Example
Get a list of the values:'''

a = thisdict.values()
#The list of the values is a view of the dictionary, meaning that any changes done to the dictionary will be reflected in the values list.

print(a)

'''Example
Make a change in the original dictionary, and see that the values list gets updated as well:'''

q = car.values()

print(q) #before the change

car["year"] = 2020

print(q) #after the change

car["power"] = "150 Kw"

print(q) #after the change

'''Get Items
The items() method will return each item in a dictionary, as tuples in a list.

Example
Get a list of the key:value pairs'''

w = thisdict.items()

print(w)

#The returned list is a view of the items of the dictionary, meaning that any changes done to the dictionary will be reflected in the items list.

'''Check if Key Exists
To determine if a specified key is present in a dictionary use the in keyword:
    Check if "model" is present in the dictionary:'''
    
if "model" in thisdict:
  print("Yes, 'model' is one of the keys in the thisdict dictionary")

'''Change Values
You can change the value of a specific item by referring to its key name:

Example
Change the "year" to 2018:'''

thisdict["year"] = 2018

'''Update Dictionary
The update() method will update the dictionary with the items from the given argument.

The argument must be a dictionary, or an iterable object with key:value pairs.

Example
Update the "year" of the car by using the update() method:'''

thisdict.update({"year": 2020})

'''Adding Items - usar uma nova index key ou update method
Adding an item to the dictionary is done by using a new index key and assigning a value to it:

Example

thisdict["color"] = "red"
print(thisdict)

Update Dictionary
The update() method will update the dictionary with the items from a given argument. If the item does not exist, the item will be added.

The argument must be a dictionary, or an iterable object with key:value pairs.

Example
Add a color item to the dictionary by using the update() method:

thisdict.update({"color": "red"})'''

'''Removing Items
There are several methods to remove items from a dictionary:

Example
The pop() method removes the item with the specified key name:'''

thisdict.pop("model")
print(thisdict)

'''Example
The popitem() method removes the last inserted item (in versions before 3.7, a random item is removed instead):'''

thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
thisdict.popitem()
print(thisdict)

'''Example
The del keyword removes the item with the specified key name:'''

thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
del thisdict["model"]
print(thisdict)

'''Example
The del keyword can also delete the dictionary completely:'''

thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
del thisdict
#print(thisdict) #this will cause an error because "thisdict" no longer exists.

'''Example
The clear() method empties the dictionary:'''

thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
thisdict.clear()
print(thisdict)

'''Loop Through a Dictionary
You can loop through a dictionary by using a for loop.

When looping through a dictionary, the return value are the keys of the dictionary, but there are methods to return the values as well.

Example
Print all key names in the dictionary, one by one:'''

thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}

for x in thisdict:
  print(x)
'''Example
Print all values in the dictionary, one by one:'''

for x in thisdict:
  print(thisdict[x])
'''Example
You can also use the values() method to return values of a dictionary:'''

for x in thisdict.values():
  print(x)
'''Example
You can use the keys() method to return the keys of a dictionary:'''

for x in thisdict.keys():
  print(x)
'''Example
Loop through both keys and values, by using the items() method:'''

for x, y in thisdict.items():
  print(x, y)

'''Copy a Dictionary
You cannot copy a dictionary simply by typing dict2 = dict1, because: dict2 will only be a reference to dict1, and changes made in dict1 will automatically also be made in dict2.

There are ways to make a copy, one way is to use the built-in Dictionary method copy().

Example
Make a copy of a dictionary with the copy() method:'''

mydict = thisdict.copy()
print(mydict)
'''Another way to make a copy is to use the built-in function dict().

Example
Make a copy of a dictionary with the dict() function:'''


mydict2 = dict(thisdict)
print(mydict)

'''Nested Dictionaries
A dictionary can contain dictionaries, this is called nested dictionaries.

Example
Create a dictionary that contain three dictionaries:'''

myfamily = {
  "child1" : {
    "name" : "Emil",
    "year" : 2004
  },
  "child2" : {
    "name" : "Tobias",
    "year" : 2007
  },
  "child3" : {
    "name" : "Linus",
    "year" : 2011
  }
}
'''Or, if you want to add three dictionaries into a new dictionary:

Example
Create three dictionaries, then create one dictionary that will contain the other three dictionaries:'''

child1 = {
  "name" : "Emil",
  "year" : 2004
}
child2 = {
  "name" : "Tobias",
  "year" : 2007
}
child3 = {
  "name" : "Linus",
  "year" : 2011
}

myfamily2 = {
  "child1" : child1,
  "child2" : child2,
  "child3" : child3
}

'''Dictionary Methods
Python has a set of built-in methods that you can use on dictionaries.

Method  	Description
clear() 	Removes all the elements from the dictionary
copy()  	Returns a copy of the dictionary
fromkeys()	Returns a dictionary with the specified keys and value
get()   	Returns the value of the specified key
items() 	Returns a list containing a tuple for each key value pair
keys()  	Returns a list containing the dictionary's keys
pop()   	Removes the element with the specified key
popitem()	Removes the last inserted key-value pair
setdefault()	Returns the value of the specified key. If the key does not exist: insert the key, with the specified value
update()	Updates the dictionary with the specified key-value pairs
values()	Returns a list of all the values in the dictionary'''
