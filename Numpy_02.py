# Slicing arrays

'''Slicing in python means taking elements from one given index to another given index.

We pass slice instead of index like this: [start:end].

We can also define the step, like this: [start:end:step].

If we don't pass start its considered 0

If we don't pass end its considered length of array in that dimension

If we don't pass step its considered 1

Example
Slice elements from index 1 to index 5 from the following array:'''

import numpy as np

arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7])

print(arr[1:5])
'''Note: The result includes the start index, but excludes the end index.

Example
Slice elements from index 4 to the end of the array:

import numpy as np

arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7])'''

print(arr[4:])
'''Example
Slice elements from the beginning to index 4 (not included):

import numpy as np

arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7])

print(arr[:4])
'''

# Negative Slicing
'''Use the minus operator to refer to an index from the end:

Example
Slice from the index 3 from the end to index 1 from the end:

import numpy as np

arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7])'''

print(arr[-3:-1])



# STEP
'''Use the step value to determine the step of the slicing:

Example
Return every other element from index 1 to index 5:

import numpy as np

arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7])'''

print(arr[1:5:2])


# Slicing 2-D Arrays
'''Example
From the second element, slice elements from index 1 to index 4 (not included):

import numpy as np

arr = np.array([[1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]])

print(arr[1, 1:4])
Note: Remember that second element has index 1.

Example
From both elements, return index 2:

import numpy as np

arr = np.array([[1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]])

print(arr[0:2, 2])
Example
From both elements, slice index 1 to index 4 (not included), this will return a 2-D array:

import numpy as np

arr = np.array([[1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]])

print(arr[0:2, 1:4])'''


# NumPy Data Types

'''Data Types in Python
By default Python have these data types:

strings - used to represent text data, the text is given under quote marks. e.g. "ABCD"
integer - used to represent integer numbers. e.g. -1, -2, -3
float - used to represent real numbers. e.g. 1.2, 42.42
boolean - used to represent True or False.
complex - used to represent complex numbers. e.g. 1.0 + 2.0j, 1.5 + 2.5j
Data Types in NumPy
NumPy has some extra data types, and refer to data types with one character, like i for integers, u for unsigned integers etc.

Below is a list of all data types in NumPy and the characters used to represent them.

i - integer
b - boolean
u - unsigned integer
f - float
c - complex float
m - timedelta
M - datetime
O - object
S - string
U - unicode string
V - fixed chunk of memory for other type ( void )
'''

# Checking the Data Type of an Array
'''The NumPy array object has a property called dtype that returns the data type of the array:

Example
Get the data type of an array object:

import numpy as np

arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4])'''

print(arr.dtype)

'''Example
Get the data type of an array containing strings:

import numpy as np'''

arr2 = np.array(['apple', 'banana', 'cherry'])

print(arr2.dtype)

# Creating Arrays With a Defined Data Type
'''We use the array() function to create arrays, this function can take an optional argument: dtype that allows us to define the expected data type of the array elements:

Example
Create an array with data type string:

import numpy as np'''

arr3 = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4], dtype='S')

print(arr3)
print(arr3.dtype)


'''For i, u, f, S and U we can define size as well.

Example
Create an array with data type 4 bytes integer:

import numpy as np

arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4], dtype='i4')

print(arr)
print(arr.dtype)'''

# What if a Value Can Not Be Converted?
''''If a type is given in which elements can't be casted then NumPy will raise a ValueError.

ValueError: In Python ValueError is raised when the type of passed argument to a function is unexpected/incorrect.

Example
A non integer string like 'a' can not be converted to integer (will raise an error):

import numpy as np

arr = np.array(['a', '2', '3'], dtype='i')'''


# Converting Data Type on Existing Arrays
'''The best way to change the data type of an existing array, is to make a copy of the array with the astype() method.

The astype() function creates a copy of the array, and allows you to specify the data type as a parameter.

The data type can be specified using a string, like 'f' for float, 'i' for integer etc. or you can use the data type directly like float for float and int for integer.

Example
Change data type from float to integer by using 'i' as parameter value:

import numpy as np'''

arr4 = np.array([1.1, 2.1, 3.1])

newarr = arr4.astype('i')

print(newarr)
print(newarr.dtype)
'''Example
Change data type from float to integer by using int as parameter value:

import numpy as np

arr = np.array([1.1, 2.1, 3.1])

newarr = arr.astype(int)

print(newarr)
print(newarr.dtype)
Example
Change data type from integer to boolean:

import numpy as np'''

arr5 = np.array([1, 0, 3])

newarr2 = arr5.astype(bool)

print(newarr2)
print(newarr2.dtype)
